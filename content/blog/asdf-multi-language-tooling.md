When you move between PHP, Ruby, Go, and TypeScript, version drift becomes a real problem. **ASDF** keeps my machines consistent without a pile of bespoke scripts.

## Why it works

- Single interface for multiple runtimes
- Project‑level version pinning
- Easy onboarding for new teammates

## My setup

I keep `.tool-versions` in the repo and let ASDF do the rest. It’s simple, and it’s reliable.

## The benefit

Less time wrestling environments means more time building features. That’s the win.

If you’re juggling multiple languages, ASDF is the calm in the storm.
