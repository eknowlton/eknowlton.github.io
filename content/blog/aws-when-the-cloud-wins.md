I love a good homelab, but sometimes the cloud is the right call. AWS wins when requirements outgrow local infrastructure.

## AWS shines when:

- You need fast, global availability
- Compliance requirements are strict
- You want managed services over maintenance

## The practical approach

I typically prototype locally and migrate to AWS when it’s time to harden. That keeps costs sane and learning high.

The best infrastructure decision is the one that fits the actual constraints.
