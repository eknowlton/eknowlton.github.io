Security programs fail when they’re too heavy. Here’s the baseline I use for teams that need to move fast *and* stay safe.

## The essentials

- **MFA everywhere**
- **Centralized logging**
- **Least privilege by default**

## Process over panic

Tighten access, monitor drift, and run small incident drills. Consistency is the real control.

Security is a product feature. When you treat it like one, teams adopt it naturally.
