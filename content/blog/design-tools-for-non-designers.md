I’m not a designer, but I still need to make things look good. These are the tools that let me ship clean UI work without pretending to be an artist.

## Figma for layout

Figma is fast for wireframes, spacing, and collaboration. It’s where most UI decisions start.

## Inkscape for vectors

When I need a crisp logo or icon tweak, Inkscape is lightweight and capable.

## GIMP for quick edits

For crops, adjustments, or small fixes, GIMP is enough — especially on a Linux daily driver.

The takeaway: good design doesn’t require exotic tools, just consistent ones.
