Mobile apps don’t get second chances. The first run decides whether people stay.

## What I prioritize

- **Cold start speed**
- **Offline‑friendly flows**
- **Consistent UI patterns**

## Feature discipline

Every new feature adds surface area for bugs and confusion. I focus on small, repeatable wins.

Great mobile apps feel effortless. That takes restraint and a lot of polish.
