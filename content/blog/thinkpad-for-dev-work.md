I’ve used ThinkPads since my first website, and the 2022 X1 Carbon Extreme is still my favorite travel‑friendly workstation. It’s not about nostalgia — it’s about consistency.

## What matters most

- **Keyboard feel**: I type all day. The ThinkPad travel reduces fatigue.
- **Port selection**: I avoid dongle‑life when I can.
- **Reliability**: Long builds, long calls, zero drama.

## The performance balance

I don’t chase “top spec.” I want a machine that compiles quickly, handles multiple containers, and still lasts through a day of meetings. The X1 Carbon Extreme hits that balance.

## The real reason

Consistency reduces cognitive load. When the machine disappears, I can focus on architecture, product decisions, and shipping code.

If you spend all day building things, the laptop should feel like a tool — not a project.
