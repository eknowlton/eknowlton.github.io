I’m firmly in the “use the right tool” camp. For me that means **Vim** when I need raw speed and **VS Code** when I need a rich view of the project.

## Vim for velocity

- Fast navigation and edits
- Low latency for quick fixes
- Ideal for SSH and server work

## VS Code for context

- Easy project‑wide search
- Great debugger support
- Extensions that save time

## The rule I follow

If I need to **think**, I’m in VS Code. If I need to **move**, I’m in Vim. The two tools complement each other, and the transition stays smooth.

The result is a workflow that’s fast, grounded, and flexible — without turning editor choice into a religion.
