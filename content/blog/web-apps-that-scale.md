When I build web apps, I optimize for **clarity** first and **scale** second. The best systems grow when the foundations are simple.

## My core principles

- **Clear boundaries** between domains
- **Stateless services** where possible
- **Observable systems** (logs, metrics, traces)

## Reliability comes from habits

Small deploys, good tests, and fast rollback paths are more important than fancy tech.

Web applications are business engines. The goal is stable momentum, not clever architecture.
